Ideas to try out:
- maintain dict of attacked squares. format = piece: attacked squares. When moved, redo attacked squares for that piece.
- maintain dict of obstructions. format = piece: obstructing piece. When obstructing piece is moved, re-evaluate
obstructing piece, and attacked squares for the piece.













Shot-down:


# reversed (if don't have to re-calculate ALL possible moves every time piece moves, then optimal)
- maintain list of attacked squares for each color in board instance (too many possible moves to keep track of)
